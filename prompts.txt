We are building an eligibility checker for potential patients to come to a non-profit healthcare clinic to obtain free healthcare. 

The application will ask the patients to share their own personal information. That information being the name and age of the respective patient, the number of people in their household, their income, and their reason why they are coming to the clinic for assistance. 

Depending on the information given from the patienct the application will be either multiple pages  if they meet the eligibilty requirements from the first page or just 2 pages if they do not meet the elibilty requirements.




The eligibility requirements are that the patience must be over 18 and also their monthly income must be under the amount based on their household size. 

Household Size: Monthly (200%)
1: $2,430
2:$3,287
3:$4,143
4:$5,000
5:$5,857
6:$6,713
7:$7,570
8:$8,427
9:$9,283
10: $10,140


We will be using an LLM library gpt-4.1-mini to power this process
